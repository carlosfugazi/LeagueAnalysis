<p>As a point of comparison to a <a href="http://arsfutbolistica.wordpress.com/2013/03/22/23/">recent (similar) analysis</a> of the Premier League in this very blog, the German Bundesliga point distribution is shown below (divided into 6 groups of 3). The focus here will be the context afforded by having these two similar tabulations.</p>

<p>The results show a relatively stable distribution through the years even as the winds of a globalized game buffet other leagues across Europe. The trend lines in this case show growth for the top 2 groups and very small negative trend in the 4 bottom performers.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-to-england">Comparing to England</h2>
<p>In terms of the magnitude of the positive trend in performance of the top teams, England's set appear to be twice as powerful as the equivalent in the German league. Additionally, the trend line in England is far more certain statistically speaking (again, twice as much by my measure).</p>
<p>Germany also boasts a far more equitable distribution of top 3 finishers (as shown in table also below). By equitable I mean the following: no one team other than Bayern has staked a permanent place among the elite over this 16 year span. Bayern really seems like an anomaly here, a veritable and singular giant in this league.</p>
<p>The fan-based ownership model in the Bundesliga seems to be lending itself to a more competitive league as evidenced in both variety of top finishers and in the share of points obtained by the very top performers year to year in the league. Also of note is that the bottom 3 (2 of which are relegated automatically, 1 of which goes to a playoff) have not lost as much ground to the higher placed sides as in the Premier League.</p>
