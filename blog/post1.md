# “Never compete with someone who has nothing to lose.”

Baltasar Gracián wisely uttered the titular words of this post back in the 1600's. I am not completely  sure if Old Baltasar ever worked out the converse of his statement, that perhaps "one should compete with someone who has nothing to gain".

This seems to be increasingly the case in the *English Premier League*. As shown in the attendant graph, the top 4 (and to a much lesser extent positions 5-8) have enjoyed a steady increase in their fortunes. Of course that bounty has meant a necessary decline of the rest, with the bottom 4 in particular feeling the pinch. If the obtained trend lines can be believed, the average gap in points generated between the bottom and top 4's has grown from 148 in 1997 to 196 in 2012 (increase of 32%). 

The membership of the top 4 is not a secret to anyone. Since 1997, we are talking about Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool (not for long seemingly). Of course, Manchester City (fueled countless gallons of a certain fossil fuel) are poised to take their place among this increasingly *elite* elite.
