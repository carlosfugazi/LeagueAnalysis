<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>&quot;I have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career (<em>graduated 2 years ago with PhD in applied mathematics</em>). Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you (<em>mainly if you are a lazy football pundit</em>).&quot;</p>

<p>The applied mathematician is a strange beast, a creature of two worlds. As Erdos observed (<em>he of the Erdos #</em>), the first is one in which coffee is converted to rigorous (<em>pure</em>) mathematical proof. Problem is, the results are intelligible to at around two people, the guy who wrote it and the journal editor that has to read it.</p>
<p>Second, there is the world of applied mathematics. A dangerous world where a mathematical model is pounded into submission upon the crucible of experimental data and observation. Here one introduces words like &quot;approximate&quot; and &quot;well enough&quot;.</p>
<p>In other words it turns out that rigor and precision give way to approximation when mathematics is confronted with the real world, but hopefully, increased understanding of how the world works. Hopefully.</p>

<p>This author really likes to watch that football bounce. Preferably on the ground. Unnecessary Stoke City dig insert here. So this blog (or hobby in older parlance), is an attempt to beat back the imperfect imprecise narrative we humans love to ascribe to events of our interest. To the best of my ability, I will attempt to quantify facts we think we know, and expose vague incorrect truisms as frauds wherever they may hide.</p>
